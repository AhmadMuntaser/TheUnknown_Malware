# TheUnknown_Malware

1.	Setting up the lab:


We start off by installing FlareVM on a Windows 10 machine

You can download it from https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm

Followed up by Installing Remnux Machine

You can download the remnux machine from https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance

By installing the above machines we have successfully created our safe environment for the analysis.

To keep up we have to change the configurations in the Oracle-VM as follows:

2.	Setting up the network of the Windows Machine

We start setting up the network of the windows machine by going through the network settings in the control panel and by selecting properties of our used network adapter and by setting the IP address manually. As shown below

3.	Testing Phase:


In this step we are testing the inetsim, by executing the following command on the remnux machine:
sudo inetsim

After executing the inetsim command we figured out that all the traffic on the windows machine will be redirected to the remnux machine. Just as shown below when we try to access the internet.

4.	Analysis:

A.	Static Analysis:

Starting the static analysis, which means analyzing the malware without execution.
We start the static analysis by using PEStudio, to see that the malware that we are analyzing is a windows executable and the hash file that it is using. Although the hash file will not be available through the internet, due to it being a new malware that is hand crafted by Dr. Haitham. As shown in the two following screenshots.
MZ means it’s a windows executable.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681329-e12f1e62-a8d3-465b-ad0d-0c0bc9b93333.png)


After we entered the command strings, we received the following output as shown in the below screenshots.
This output shows the string of the malware program, they give us indications about what the malware is doing.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681377-f61d40a4-989d-41ca-8fcd-86ad8ab8812a.png)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681419-6f1f4513-8eab-4608-b6f3-6b8509d0f556.png)


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681438-c1ac38a5-134f-4d5b-ac87-c5a3e171135f.png)

We were able to analyze some of the above strings, which grabbed our attention such as:
Psut.dll is missing!  This message pops up as soon as you execute the malware, which is there to just confuse the user.
No internet, No Game  This message pops up if you try and execute the malware while not connected to the internet.
Updator.exe  seems interesting here. We still have no clue what this does yet.
CaesarCipher  seems interesting, why would an application have CaesarCipher string in it? Soon we will figure out.
Example.com  seems interesting as well.





B.	Dynamic Analysis:

Starting the dynamic analysis means analyzing the malware after its execution. 
We start our dynamic analysis by checking the Process Monitor Filter (PMF).


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681562-f700ac0d-9756-4d1f-9a5d-2a858c52541f.png)


The Following Screenshots are network indicators that are showing us that the malware is trying to create a network connection to Microsoft.com (SC1) & Google.com (SC2) as well.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681613-fcc08b28-9494-4997-85e6-f9f0cc65e49e.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681673-e904ace9-f647-4400-ac0f-89d7d993820b.png)

We found something interesting while analyzing the network to find out that there is a GET that is trying to download something. Although we had no internet connection at that point yet.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681699-c6febf8e-b126-4d6d-8fc7-b476ff277aa1.png)

The following screenshot shows the following that had the respond stream (next TCP stream in the wireshark for GET – download).


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681743-46e7a0a1-23a6-4ceb-8702-4d09f103f7b1.png)



And we can see this POST request to /post_handler
After connecting to the internet we went back to the Wireshark to complete our network analysis and we found out that the malware is trying to download something on our device.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681781-faa16c64-5194-4933-b243-bd2de088a52c.png)

The following screenshot assures us that the malware is trying to have a connection on google.com


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681832-2e24df08-05f9-46bf-a9c3-8d9de1e756a9.png)




Host indicator:
We found out after further on the analysis that when connected to the internet the malware creates a new text folder in the C:\Users Directory that has an encrypted paragraph in it as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681864-ec168d16-fc28-41ce-bbaa-9ff5f63c90c6.png)

It seems that the malware encrypts using caser cipher and here is the decryption form of Hacked.txt as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681888-98153fe7-d477-4ba9-92ee-37d828e0f642.png)


After analyzing seems like this malware is trying to steal the device’s information, based on the folder it created that had encrypted paragraph with Creaser Cipher algorithm, so we decided to decrypt the content of the text folder to find out that the decryption is our device’s name as shown below.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681939-5a3c71c7-b18d-4d73-bff7-af36e2b872ec.png)


After we followed the process of the executable (updator.exe) on Process Monitor, we found out that it is the main cause of the creation of the text folder (hacked.txt) and it is the process that is responsible of stealing the device’s information. As shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103259604/213681964-875fd1de-2ee0-4dc8-bef8-de7a6723698b.png)
